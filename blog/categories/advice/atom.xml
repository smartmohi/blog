<blockquote><p><strong>Mind voice: </strong> Are you a Yoda fan?</p>

<p><strong>Me: </strong> Nope, I came to know Yoda is a fictional character in the Star Wars just today.</p>

<p><strong>Mind voice: </strong> Don&rsquo;t say me you never watched Star Wars?</p>

<p><strong>Me: </strong> I swear, I didn&rsquo;t yet. Used above banner as it match with my blog topic.</p></blockquote>

<p>Over the recent days, I come to a validated result that all our assumptions stop us from thinking beyond. We always underestimate most things saying &ldquo;c'mon! I knew how this works, so this won&rsquo;t fit&rdquo;. This is a pure laziness to unlearn our assumption.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>People use to say that we are not using our brain to the extent we could. But the fact is we are unable to learn beyond certain point due to the assumptions that had created by the things we had learn so far. It&rsquo;s not just enough to keep us up-to date with all that we need to learn, it&rsquo;s equally important to unlearn certain things which are unnecessary.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Mind voice: </strong> Given me an example, let me see if unlearning is worth it.</p>

<p><strong>Me: </strong> Okay, let me try</p></blockquote>

<h2>Why do I say unlearning is so important?</h2>

<p>From my previous experience, I strongly believe that change is the only thing which is constant in this super fast world. If you still keep remembering  unnecessary sad memories it would be your first enemy to pull your leg. Just unlearn your worries to start learn more on shaping your life much happier than before.</p>

<p>You would have seen many of your friends changed after few years. Your distance increases and the wave length mismatch, finally you end up getting used to his/her new life. Knowingly or unknowingly we unlearn our previous assumptions on our friends and get ready to accept the change. This seems to be a default human behavior but the fact is when you realize that unlearning is much important to learn again, we take life easy.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Mind voice: </strong> Are you trying to say &ldquo;just forget&rdquo; the past?</p>

<p><strong>Me: </strong> For sure, NO. You need to learn lesson from your experience at the same time unlearn only the assumptions you have made.</p>

<p><strong>Mind voice: </strong> You are really complicating this man. Say me clearly.</p>

<p><strong>Me: </strong> Okay, Just unlearn what were i said before. Learn from lessons; unlearn your assumptions. Clear now?</p></blockquote>

<p>All the miracles and impossibles are made possible just because someone unlearn what we all learnt. He/She had unlearnt their learning to make sure they make us learn something new.</p>

<p>Do you agree with &ldquo;learn to unlearn&rdquo; is important and it&rsquo;s mandatory in this changing ecosystem?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With my personal and professional experience and from my peer network recently i understood the importance of saying NO.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Mind voice:</strong> Are you kidding me by teaching to simply say NO?</p>

<p><strong>Me:</strong> Saying NO is not that easy.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Why should you STOP saying YES?</h2>

<ul>
<li>When you want to focus on some thing then the first challenge is to boldly say NO to other things.</li>
<li>By saying YES, you are allowing others to start building an expectation from your end.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Learn to say "NO&rdquo;. If someone asks for your help and you don&rsquo;t have the time or energy, be honest and admit you can&rsquo;t offer your assistance at the moment. It can be hard to turn requests down (especially from those close to you), but the more you pile on your plate, the less productive you&rsquo;ll be &ndash; and the more stressed out you&rsquo;ll become.</li>
<li>More than anything some times your silence is also taken as YES often, so be bold enough to say NO.</li>
<li>If you say YES to everything; people will think you have lot of free time than them.</li>
<li>If you are used to say YES then you may loose control of what you are focusing on.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t say YES just because others are nodding their head, you always need to think deeply.</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p><strong>Mind voice:</strong> Okay ok, But what is that big slap in the title of this post?</p>

<p><strong>Me:</strong> Oh ya, let me brief it too.</p></blockquote>

<h2>The Big Slap</h2>

<ul>
<li>When I was not aware of start-up ecosystem I said YES to regular 9-6 job.</li>
<li>I also was unable to say NO because i said YES to all the challenges given to me.</li>
<li>After two years I understood, I was kept busy because i started to say YES to everything.</li>
<li>When one day I looked back I found I&rsquo;m moving slow and my track is already  diverted.</li>
<li>Just because my parents wanted me to learn by working, i witnessed that salary is an addiction. Once you started enjoying money getting credited to your account every month you will start getting adopted by compromising yourself. (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/iswarya.shakthi.3" title="Ish Akka FB">Mrs. Iswarya Shakthi</a> Sis, I acknowledge it now)</li>
<li>I then realize this is not my cup of tea.</li>
</ul>


<p>The costliest learning by investing nearly three years of my youth energy is STOP saying YES to everything.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Mind voice:</strong> My HR team or my boss should not send me a memo for the below picture.</p>

<p><strong>Me:</strong> No way man, you have a note below ;)</p></blockquote>

<p><img src="http://richerthanyourboss.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Q5-If-You-Dont-Build-Your-Dreams-Someone-Else-Will-Hire-You-To-Help-Build-Theirs-Tony-Gaskin-752x1024.png" alt="If You Donâ€™t Build Your Dreams, Someone Will Hire You To Help Build Theirs" /></p>

<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> All the above are my personal view it does not have any relationship with any of the organization, company or person in particular.</em></p>

<p>If you also feel one need to STOP saying YES to everything, please share the reason in comment&rsquo;s section below.</p>

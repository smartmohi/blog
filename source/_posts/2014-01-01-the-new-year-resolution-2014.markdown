## Wish you all a very happy new year 2014! ##

I had good fun being at MG road, Bangalore at mid night 00:00 with [@karthi_govind](http://twitter.com/karthi_govind "Karthik Govindasamy") and Kadiyala Aditya.

Fine lets come to the topic, as usual I did list down few of the habits and skills i would like to cultivate this year. After deep thoughts put in, I decided to start writing my personal blog this year.

> 
> **Mind voice**: Okay man cool! but what's new?
>
> **Me**: How could host a blog without paying to web server?
> 
> **Mind voice**: Come on man! you proclaim as the so called open source "[solutions consultant](www.linkedin.com/in/smartmohi "Mohankumar S LinkedIn profile")", solve this now!
> 
> **Me**: I had four options to choose Wordpress.com, Tumblr, Blogger or Github.

<!-- more -->
1. **[Wordpress](http://wordpress.com "Free blogging platform")** : Nope!
I did not like the way wordpress.com force display ads on our blog post when its a free package.

1. **[Tumblr](http://www.tumblr.com "Follow the blogs you've been hearing about.")**: Nope again!
Felt awesome for personal blogging but still was not happy as i would end up on a Yahoo product.

1. **[Blogger](http://www.blogger.com "Free weblog publishing tool from Google, for sharing text, photos and video")**: Nope please!
I do not want it to happen as Google Reader (My favorite RSS reader).

1. **[Github](http://github.com "Build software better, together.")**: Yeah cool! Having prior experience in hosting [my website](http://www.smartmohi.com "Mohankumar Swaminathan personal website") using Github Pages, felt okay let me give a try. 

Then found out [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/ "Transform your plain text into static websites and blogs.") is the best static website generation for Github Pages. 

> **Mind voice**: Hey hold on, its on [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/ "Ruby Language") man! Ha ha you never wrote a "[hello world](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_world_program "Hello world program")" other than [LAMP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_software_bundle "Linux Apache MySQL PHP") :D
> 
> **Me**: So what! let me give a try. I have [@kjaikeerthi](https://twitter.com/kjaikeerthi "Jai Keerthi") who is an expert in [RoR](http://rubyonrails.org/ "Ruby on Rails"). He is just a dial away. 

Some time back Vaibhav Rajput said on a facebook comment there exist a blogging framework for [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/ "Websites for you and your projects.") called [OctoPress](http://octopress.org/ "Octopress")

Meanwhile I also recollected [@ArnDvd](https://twitter.com/ArnDvd "Arun David") published his blog post in Github using Jekyll.

Finally decided to go with Octopress as its a blogging framework for hackers and could be deployed on Github Pages for free.

> **Mind voice**: I don't know why you are writing so technical when you have [Tinywall.info](http://www.tinywall.info "Tinywall Infomedia - Indian Technology Blog") and you said this is your personal blog.
> 
> **Me**: Oh yeah! let me not delete the above just go ahead writing **why I choose blogging as new year resolution?**

**Basically for five reasons**

- Writing personal dairy are out dated; so practice personal blogging
- Improve my writing skills
- Open up, Express and exchange
- Add new technology (Ruby) to my skill set
- Test drive on SEO and SMO
- Increase page ranking for my website

What do you feel about my this year resolution? please let me know below via [comments](#disqus_thread "Comments").

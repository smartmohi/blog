Every engineering student has a prayer to get the easiest program like [Fibonacci series](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number "Fibonacci number") in their practical exam. I too had! 

When I sit in fresher interview panel i wish to see their [github](http://resume.github.io/ "Github Resume") contribution and blog rather than their well drafted resume.

## Why don't the evaluation methodology of practical exams improve? ##

I hate the concept of 3 hours exam to evaluate your practical skill. Instead of wasting time in reinventing the wheel and vomiting the same code on practical exam, students can contribute to open source community.

> **Mind voice**: Sounds complicated man! Explain in simple English.

**Consider the following**

- Students have 6 months for one semester, they have approximately 2 class every week for 5 months. (3 hrs * 2 classes * 4 weeks * 5 months = 120 hours)
- There is a huge gap between industry need and academic curriculum 
- Github have more than [10 million Repositories](https://github.com/blog/1724-10-million-repositories "Github 2013")
- Reading resumes are boring for interviewer

**Learn the open source way**

- Create an account in any revision control system like [Github](http://github.com "Build software better, together."), [Google Code](https://code.google.com/projecthosting/ "Google Project Hosting powers Project Hosting on Google Code and Eclipse Labs"), [Sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net/ "SourceForge - Download, Develop and Publish Free Open Source") etc.
- Pick any open source project of your interest on the practical lab [language](https://github.com/trending "Trending repositories on GitHub today")
- Fork and start understanding the application and follow the development road map.
- Pick any module from road map or any task from the [issue](https://github.com/blog/831-issues-2-0-the-next-generation "Issues 2.0: The Next Generation")
- Code it yourself and give a [pull](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests "Using Pull Requests") request
- If your code meets the coding standard, quality assurance and functionality then the lead developer will accept the pull request and your code will be added to the next release.
- Your name is also added to [contributes list](https://github.com/blog/643-contributors "Github Top contributers") and you are solving a real time problem with your skill set   

**Advantages to student**

- Student name will be in credit list when the project is released
- Satisfaction in contributing to the open source community 
- Social coding helps to stay connected and learn more
- He/she will be industry ready 
- Up-to-date on technology standards
- Experience to work on enterprise application development
- Improve coding standard
- Understand the importance of testing and documentation  


**Advantages to instructor**

- Full code control on [repositories](https://github.com/edu "Request an educational account")
- No need to review the code as the code is already accepted by the industry experts.
- Instead of reading the same old age coding, it would be interesting to see your students solve the real time problem on a open source project
- No way for plagiarism  
- You can be the leader who "[walk the talk](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/walk_the_talk "walk the talk")".
- Students will have more respect on seeing your code contribution to the community on open source projects

**Change I wish to see by this method**

- Soon India will move from being a software service provider country to a quality software product development country
- Colleges to seed the courage to make every engineer student into an entrepreneur and start-up on their own.

I wish today's schools and colleges adopt this type of [win-win](https://www.google.co.in/search?q=define%3A+win-win) learning path. It's time for us to realize now a days knowledge is *Learning-by-doing*.

***Note:** I studied in an engineering college so wrote to my fellow juniors  knowing the process followed but the above could be applied to any degree.*

Do you wish feel this way of learning makes sense? Please let me know your [comments](#disqus_thread "Comments") below.
